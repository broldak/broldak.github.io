- Started at LinkedIn in 2015 as a "Web Developer" (before we all were converted to Software Engineers). I primarily worked on Job Search which was a standalone web application at the time.
- Moved over to the enterprise side of the business and launched [LinkedIn Talent Insights](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/product-tips/linkedin-talent-insights-now-available) in 2018.
- Began managing a team of 4 in 2020. Scaled this to up to a team of 15 engineers over the next three years. We maintained LinkedIn Talent Insights and owned features in the Hiring Platform reporting suite.
